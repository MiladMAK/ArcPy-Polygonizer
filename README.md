# ArcPy-Polygonizer
This is an attempt to replicate the QGIS plug-in called Polygonizer created by Frank Hereford at City of Austin Transportation and Public Works Department
# Background
A QGIS plugin ((https://github.com/frankhereford/qgis-polygonizer)https://github.com/frankhereford/qgis-polygonizer) has successfully fulfilled the purpose of this algorithm. However, due to the relative slow processing and multiple platforms involved (QGIS, AGOL, ArcPro) I thought it might be useful to make an algorithm that can do the job directly inside ArcPro.
