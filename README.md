# ArcPy-Polygonizer
This attempts to replicate the QGIS plug-in called Polygonizer created by **Frank Hereford** at the City of Austin Transportation and Public Works Department. The two attempts (ArcPyPolygonizer) differ in some details but have the same structure.
# Background from the QGIS plugin Repository 
As part of the Austin Transportation and Public Works Department, the Vision Zero team operates a database of crashes in and around the Austin city limits. A point position tracks these crashes, and to analyze the city's roadways about crash location and crash severity, a set of polygons was created based on the street network. These polygons are of approximately equal area and are formed so that intersections are built into a single shape, and interconnecting roads between intersections are divided into equal segments. Aggregating crashes into these polygons makes comparisons between intersections and road segments possible.

# Background 2
A working QGIS plugin (https://github.com/frankhereford/qgis-polygonizer) has successfully fulfilled the purpose of this algorithm. However, due to the relatively slow processing and multiple platforms involved (QGIS, AGOL, ArcPro) and the complexity, it is useful to make an algorithm that can do the job directly inside ArcPro.
# The QGIS Plugin Workflow
To create and correct polygons at any ASMP level (https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2a3c539da76b4f49906a3524ed4a2cc9) the workflow comprises:
1- Preparing a reference street network in QGIS (calling CTN (https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=52347b99aba448e0a7e5d4b9a5cb09f9&layerId=0) layer through AGOL)
2- Select (active selection by drawing a rectangle around the chosen streets) the chosen streets
3- Running the plugin, which has sliders to choose the width, length, and segment length
4- Edit the created polygons inside QGIS
5- Transfer the polygons (e.g., as a shapefile) to ArcPro 
6- Push the new sets of polygons (created or corrected) to the "maint" database inside **ATD_ADMIN.vision_zero_polygons**

 # Problem
Multiple shortcomings might occur while using the QGIS plugin, which can be solved with some workarounds. However, this might not be quickly achievable for a non-experienced analyst. A tool inside ArcPro can provide a faster solution and a quicker switch between editing polygons and creating them from scratch.

# Proposed solution through ArcPy Polygonizer
These proposed algorithms, upon being completed, can be converted to tools in ArcPro where the user needs only to provide the street network and intersection layers. The rest will be taken care of through the program.

# Algorithm 
ArcPy Polygonizer is created following the documentation at https://atd-dts.gitbook.io/atd-geospatial/miscelaneous/vision-zero-polygon-maintenance.


# Process
Creating buffers first and then creating intermediate sections can be a valid approach, and it may sometimes simplify the logic. However, whether it's better to create buffers before or after creating intermediate sections depends on your project's specific requirements and constraints.

Here are some considerations for both approaches:

# Creating Buffers First:

Simpler Logic: This approach can be simpler to implement because you create buffers for all street segments first, then focus on identifying intersections and creating intermediate sections.

Full Coverage: It ensures complete buffer coverage for all street segments, which can be useful if you need to analyze or visualize the buffer areas independently.

Flexibility: You can perform additional analyses on the buffered segments before creating intermediate sections.

# Creating Intermediate Sections First:

Efficiency: If your primary goal is to identify and represent the intersections where buffered segments meet, creating intermediate sections first might be more efficient, as you only generate polygons where necessary.

Reduces Data Volume: It can reduce the data volume because you don't need to store buffers for all street segments, only for the segments that contribute to intersections.

Complex Intersections: If your dataset contains complex intersections with multiple street segments converging, creating intermediate sections first can help you capture the exact geometry of those intersections.

Choosing these approaches often depends on your project's specific requirements and constraints. Creating intermediate sections first can be a good strategy if your project primarily focuses on the intersections. However, creating buffers first may be preferable if you need buffers for other purposes or want to maintain a complete buffer coverage.

Ultimately, the decision should align with the goals of your project and how you plan to use the resulting spatial data.

# Sample data:

The sample data on which the code is tested is as follows.

The sample data comprises a line segment extracted from CTN and a point dataset extracted from intersections between line segments.
